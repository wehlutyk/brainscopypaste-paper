# Brains Copy Paste paper

Latex source to our "Brains Copy Paste" paper, analyzing mutation in quotes when they propagate through the blog- and news-spaces (this should tell us stuff on how the brain copy-pastes and alters quotes when doing so).

The software used to build this paper is at [wehlutyk/brainscopypaste](https://github.com/wehlutyk/brainscopypaste). It's readable, documented, released under the GNU/GPLv3 licence, and as such meant to be read and reused.

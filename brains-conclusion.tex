\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Main contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item large \emph{in vivo} psycholinguistics experiment, emphasizing the importance of the semantic network structure (Wordnet: Pagerank, degree, clustering[, distance?]), finely describing the impact of classically-influent psycholinguistic variables (\emph{aoa}, number of phonemes, etc.); 
\item new in the sense that it does not focus on ease of recall but rather bias of substitution, and that in this respect it not only provides a finer description of the bias but also corresponds to an  ``input-output'' reformulation couple describing the joint properties of (substituted$\rightarrow$substituting) terms.
\item beyond that, provide the first bricks of an empirical \emph{fitness landscape} for the epidemiology of representations
\end{itemize}
